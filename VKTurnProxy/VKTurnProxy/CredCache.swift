// CredCache.swift
//
// Reads creds-pool.json from the App Group container shared with the
// Network Extension. The extension writes this file (see Go-side
// credPool.saveToDisk in pkg/proxy/creds.go) after every successful
// VK cred fetch and after every cred invalidation.
//
// Purpose on the app side: before kicking off a pre-bootstrap captcha
// probe in TunnelManager.connect(), check whether we have a still-valid
// cred cached from a recent session. If yes, use it as the seeded TURN
// cred and skip the entire VK API + captcha round-trip — most of the
// "user reconnected within ~8h" cases never need to talk to VK at all.
//
// The file is intentionally NOT cleaned up on app side. The Go side is
// the only writer; we only read. Stale entries (past their VK-encoded
// expiry) are filtered at read time by parsing the username's
// `<unix_expiry>:<key_id>` prefix per draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest.
