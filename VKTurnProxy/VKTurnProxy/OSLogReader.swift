/// In-process os_log reader, used as a fallback for the in-app Logs UI
/// when the SharedLogger file (in the App Group container) is empty or
/// unavailable.
///
/// The classic case is a process where
/// `FileManager.default.containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)`
/// returns nil — improper code signing on a sideloaded IPA, an iOS
/// behaviour change, etc. In that state SharedLogger silently no-ops on
/// every `log()` call and `readLogs()` returns an empty string, so the
/// in-app Logs view shows nothing — even though every log line ALSO went
/// to os_log via `os_log()` (Swift) and `os_log_create + os_log` (Go via
/// the cgo bridge). This reader gives us a way to recover those entries
/// from the live in-memory ring buffer iOS keeps per process.
///
/// Limitations:
///   - Per-process only. Each process can read its OWN os_log entries
///     via `OSLogStore(scope: .currentProcessIdentifier)`. To get the
///     extension's entries from the main app, the extension must be
///     asked over `sendProviderMessage` to read its own and return them.
///   - In-memory ring buffer. Once the process restarts (jetsam,
///     normal disconnect, system reboot), the previous entries are
///     gone. Persistent archive (`OSLogStore.local()`) requires
///     entitlements iOS apps don't get.
///   - iOS 15+. Returns "" on older systems (deployment target is 15
///     so this is a non-issue today, kept for safety).

    /// "what just happened before the user opened the Logs view" while
    /// keeping the providerMessage payload small enough to round-trip
    /// comfortably (typical density is ~5-50 entries/min, so 30 min
    /// ≈ 150-1500 lines ≈ tens of KB).

    /// extension Go via cgo bridge, plus the main app's brief Go
    /// usage in pre-bootstrap captcha probe) and `com.vkturnproxy.app`
    /// (main app Swift). The OR predicate matches entries from either.
